The laws of quantum mechanics dictate that the energies of a bound system, such as an atom, have certain discrete values. An electromagnetic field at a particular frequency can boost an atom from one energy level to a higher one, or an atom at a high energy level can drop to a lower level by emitting energy. The resonance frequency, fo, of an atomic oscillator is the difference between the two energy levels divided by Planck’s constant, h.\n\nThe principle underlying the atomic oscillator is that since all atoms of a specific element are identical, they should produce exactly the same frequency when they absorb or release energy. In theory, the atom is a perfect “pendulum” whose oscillations are counted to measure a time interval. The national frequency standards developed by NIST and other laboratories derive their resonance frequency from the cesium atom and typically use cesium fountain technology. Rubidium oscillators are the lowest priced and most common atomic oscillators, but cesium beam and hydrogen maser atomic oscillators are also sold commercially in much smaller quantities."}

Comparison of two features always yields a binary {0, 1} outcome indicating a match or non-match; because features are defined as the most basic comparison unit that the algorithm considers, partial matches are not permitted. Generally, a feature can be any value derived from an artifact. Each approximate matching algorithm must define the structure of its features and the method by which they are derived. For example, an algorithm might define a feature as a (byte, offset) pair produced by reading the value of a byte and storing it along with the offset at which it was read."}

NIST officially withdrew from the partnership in 2007 but NSA continues to manage and operate the program. The key operational component of NIAP is the Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme (CCEVS) which is the only U.S. Government- sponsored and endorsed program for conducting internationally-recognized security evaluations of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) information assurance (IA) and IA-enabled information technology products. NIAP employs the CCEVS to provide government oversight or “validation” to U.S. Common Criteria (CC) evaluations to ensure correct conformance to the International Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation (ISO/IEC 15408)."}

The group responsible for defending an enterprise’s use of information systems by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attackers (i.e., the Red Team). Typically the Blue Team and its supporters must defend against real or simulated attacks 1) over a significant period of time, 2) in a representative operational context (e.g., as part of an operational exercise), and 3) according to rules established and monitored with the help of a neutral group refereeing the simulation or exercise (i.e., the White Team).  \n2. The term Blue Team is also used for defining a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on the Blue Team findings and expertise, they provide recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cyber security readiness posture. Often a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team employment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems."}

These commands typically execute substantially faster than attempting to rewrite through the native read and write interface. The ATA standard clearly identifies that the Sanitization operations must address user data areas, user data areas not currently allocated (including “previously allocated areas and physical sectors that have become inaccessible”), and user data caches. The resulting media contents vary based on the command used. The overwrite command allows the user to specify the data pattern applied to the media, so that pattern (or the inverse of that pattern, if chosen) will be written to the media (although the actual contents of the media may vary due to encoding). The result of the block erase command is vendor unique, but will likely be 0s or 1s. The result of the crypto scramble command is vendor unique, but will likely be cryptographically scrambled data (except for areas that were not encrypted, which are set to the value the vendor defines)."}

The normal erase, as defined in the standard, is only required to address data in the contents of LBA 0 through the greater of READ NATIVE MAX or READ NATIVE MAX EXT, and replaces the contents with 0s or 1s. The enhanced erase command specifies that, “…all previously written user data shall be overwritten, including sectors that are no longer in use due to reallocation” and the contents of the media following Sanitization are vendor unique. The actual action performed by an enhanced erase varies by vendor and model, and could include a variety of actions that have varying levels of effectiveness. The secure erase command is not defined in the SCSI standard, so it does not apply to media with a SCSI interface."}

Separation of duties can be enforced either statically (by defining conflicting roles, i.e., roles which cannot be executed by the same user) or dynamically (by enforcing the control at access time). An example of dynamic separation of duty is the two-person rule. The first user to execute a two-person operation can be any authorized user, whereas the second user can be any authorized user different from the first [R.S. Sandhu., and P Samarati, “Access Control: Principles and Practice,” IEEE Communications Magazine 32(9), September 1994, pp. 40-48.].
